              <p><span style="font: size 20px;color: skyblue;"></span><p style="color:antiquewhite">32,500+ BCE: During the Upper Paleolithic period, early people would keep track of the Moon’s phases by engraving lines onto animal bones, and it has also been suggested that they might similarly have memorialized certain star patterns in the same way. One famous example includes a small piece of a mammoth tusk discovered in the Ach Valley in Germany dated between 32,500 and 38,000 years old which is purported to depict the constellation of Orion</p>
              <p><span style="font: size 20px;color: skyblue;"></span><p style="color:antiquewhite">10,000+ BCE: To early humans, the sky was where the gods dwelt and so early priests were holy men who interpreted their divine will through a careful study of astronomy mixed with religion. Astronomy was also an important component of human life, as it could be used as a method to predict the cycle of the seasons for agricultural purposes, as well as for measuring time and direction. This became especially important with the advent of the Agricultural Revolution during the Mesolithic to Neolithic period around 12,500 years ago.

The earliest astronomical records and star catalogs were kept by the Sumerians, then Babylonians, with the earliest known clay tablets recording the position of the planets, and solar eclipses dating to around 1600 BCE. </p>

Galileo’s attempts to defend the heliocentric model of the universe landed him in direct conflict with the powerful church. In 1632 he was tried for heresy, forced to recant and condemned to spend the rest of his life under house arrest.</p>

Newton later publishes his hugely influential book called ‘Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica’ in which he agrees that the Earth rotates around the Sun and explains the reasons behind Kepler’s three laws. He also establishes the law of universal gravitation, which ushered in a new Age of physics and Enlightenment. </p>
